———
Within the CPO stack, the most direct economic leverage is in external laser sources (ELS) based on high‑power InP DFB/EML devices. These lasers sit off‑package and feed multiple silicon‑photonics engines, so a small group of InP laser vendors effectively controls a disproportionate amount of value. The companies with the clearest positive leverage to CPO lasers are Lumentum, Coherent, Furukawa Electric, Sivers Semiconductors (Sivers Photonics), POET Technologies (through ELS modules), and a set of Chinese and Japanese vendors with meaningful but less pure exposure such as Sumitomo Electric, Innolight/Eoptolink, and O‑Net. Lumentum is the most concentrated liquid public vehicle for CPO lasers among large‑cap names; Sivers and POET provide higher‑beta small‑cap leverage; Coherent and Furukawa add more diversified but still material exposure.  ￼

CPO lasers themselves are becoming a distinct segment. NVIDIA’s Quantum‑X and Spectrum‑X silicon‑photonics switches depend on external UHP lasers delivering around 400 mW per channel at 1310 nm into ELS units that are pluggable at the faceplate. ￼ Each switch can incorporate &gt;100 individual laser channels, so total laser content per system is an order of magnitude higher than in a traditional pluggable optics architecture. The Mizuho Lumentum report assumes UHP DFB lasers at $50–100 per device, ~8 lasers per ELS, and ~16–18 ELS per 128–144‑port CPO switch, implying roughly $10k–20k of laser content per high‑end switch.  ￼ As other CPO platforms emerge, that laser bill of materials will be replicated across multiple ASIC vendors and hyperscalers. Because only a handful of manufacturers can reliably deliver high‑power, low‑noise, long‑lifetime InP lasers at these power levels, industry structure is oligopolistic and pricing power is stronger than in commodity pluggable optics.

Lumentum has the single strongest, cleanest exposure to CPO lasers. It is already the market leader in 100G/200G EML lasers for pluggables with &gt;50–60% share of high‑speed EML lanes in AI data centers and is now positioning its UHP 1310 nm DFB lasers explicitly for CPO.  Lumentum has been publicly named as a key laser supplier in NVIDIA’s silicon‑photonics ecosystem, with its high‑power, high‑efficiency lasers described as “crucial” to Spectrum‑X Photonics switches. ￼ The company is expanding U.S. production of these UHP lasers at its San Jose InP fab and is described as a “primary supplier to the industry” for CPO lasers, with capacity expansion explicitly tied to AI‑driven CPO demand. ￼ In the Mizuho model, CPO revenue from these UHP CW lasers is projected to rise from essentially $0 in FY25 to ~$93M in FY26, ~$356M in FY27, and ~$517M in FY28, reaching ~13% of total revenue and carrying &gt;50% gross margins.  ￼ Given that total laser revenue is expected to be ~$2.2B in FY28, about half of corporate revenue, CPO lasers alone could represent roughly 20–25% of laser revenue and a substantially higher share of incremental laser profit.  ￼ Among large‑cap names, Lumentum therefore has the highest combination of (1) explicit design‑in status for CPO lasers, (2) visible capacity expansion for CPO‑grade InP, and (3) financial disclosure tying outsize EPS growth directly to CPO laser ramps.

Coherent is the other major Western InP laser supplier with clear CPO leverage, though its exposure is diluted by a broader product set that includes industrial lasers, materials processing, and other photonics. Coherent has announced sampling of low‑noise 400 mW CW lasers specifically marketed for silicon‑photonics and CPO platforms, highlighting their role in solving high‑power, low‑noise challenges for co‑packaged optical interconnects. ￼ The company is building a 6‑inch InP fab in Sherman, Texas, which is expected to expand InP laser production capacity by &gt;5x, explicitly citing accelerating demand from datacom, AI, and CPO applications. ￼ Coherent has also been named as one of NVIDIA’s “ecosystem innovation collaborators” for silicon‑photonics networking switches using CPO, confirming that it is engaged at the platform level. ￼ However, Coherent’s overall business is significantly more diversified than Lumentum’s, and lasers for CPO are only 1 of several growth vectors (alongside transceivers, LiDAR, industrial lasers, etc.). The positive leverage exists but the beta to CPO lasers per dollar of equity is lower than for Lumentum, and the internal business mix reduces the direct sensitivity of earnings to CPO laser volumes.

Furukawa Electric is an important, though less pure, CPO laser and ELS supplier. Furukawa has been one of the earliest demonstrators of CPO‑specific external laser sources. It exhibited a pigtailed‑QSFP ELS for CPO at OFC 2022, integrating an 8‑channel TOSA and control electronics in a pluggable QSFP housing. ￼ Subsequent technical work reported record energy‑efficient ELS designs achieving 8 channels at 100 mW per channel with total power consumption of 5.6 W, which is directly targeted at CPO use cases. ￼ Independent industry commentary highlights Furukawa’s vertical integration from InP laser epitaxy through TOSA and ELSFP module assembly as a competitive advantage versus more disaggregated suppliers. ￼ At the corporate level, Furukawa is a diversified wire, cable, and components manufacturer with a large legacy telecom and power business, so CPO lasers are still a relatively small contributor to total revenue. Nevertheless, within the Japanese listed universe it is 1 of the few direct beneficiaries of rising CPO laser volumes, with the caveat that financial leverage to CPO is modest relative to the scale of the group.

Sivers Semiconductors, through its Sivers Photonics division, provides very high operational leverage to CPO lasers from a small‑cap European base. Sivers Photonics positions itself as a customized III‑V photonics foundry for communications and sensing, including InP laser arrays for advanced optical interconnects. ￼ It has worked with imec and ASM AMICRA on integrating InP lasers with silicon‑photonics platforms, including external cavity laser sources suitable for emerging optical interconnect applications. ￼ In 2025, Sivers announced 2 explicit CPO‑laser partnerships: (1) a collaboration with POET Technologies to co‑develop external light source modules for CPO and next‑generation AI infrastructure, using Sivers’ high‑power lasers integrated on POET’s optical interposer, and (2) a strategic OEM partnership with O‑Net Technologies, where Sivers’ DFB laser arrays will be integrated into O‑Net’s ELSFP modules aimed at CPO for switches, NICs, and AI systems. ￼ Given Sivers’ relatively small revenue base, any meaningful commercialization of these CPO ELS programs would translate into very high earnings leverage. The risk profile is correspondingly high, as the company is still in the ramp and qualification phase rather than mass CPO deployment.

POET Technologies offers more indirect but still meaningful leverage to CPO lasers via ELS modules rather than laser die. Its optical interposer platform is designed to integrate multiple photonic components, including lasers, into scalable ELS modules suitable for CPO. The recently announced collaboration with Sivers targets high‑performance external light source modules for CPO and AI fabrics, with Sivers providing high‑power lasers and POET providing the integration and packaging. ￼ In this structure, POET’s economic exposure is to the module ASP and integration value, while Sivers retains the pure laser content leverage. POET’s equity, however, will trade with the perceived success or failure of these ELS programs, so it can be considered a second‑order play on CPO lasers with additional upside from other photonics applications.

Several other vendors have material but more diversified exposure to lasers that can be used in CPO, even if CPO is not yet a dominant revenue driver. Sumitomo Electric and Mitsubishi Electric both manufacture InP laser diodes and related photonic components, and are cited as relevant competitors in high‑speed optical lasers that could be designed into CPO platforms.  ￼ Innolume, a German InP laser specialist, showcases high‑power lasers and CPO‑related demonstrations at OFC and similar conferences, although the company is private and thus not directly investable via public markets. ￼ In China, companies such as Innolight, Eoptolink, Accelink, and HG Genuine are aggressively expanding 400G/800G optical module production and are beginning to invest in SiPho and potentially ELS for CPO. ￼ Their current economics are dominated by pluggable modules rather than ELS units, but over time they may backward‑integrate into CPO‑grade laser arrays, especially for domestic Chinese CPO deployments. O‑Net, via its partnership with Sivers, is already positioning to supply ELSFP modules for CPO and thus has a hybrid module‑plus‑laser exposure. ￼

Broadcom, Marvell, Cisco (via Acacia), and NVIDIA itself are central to the CPO ecosystem but have limited direct leverage to discrete lasers. Broadcom and Marvell are primarily SerDes, DSP, and switch‑ASIC suppliers; their CPO economics sit in the photonic engine, silicon, and packaging rather than the laser die. Cisco’s exposure is centered on integrated optical modules and CPO engines through its acquisition of Acacia. NVIDIA will capture most of the system‑level value in CPO switches, but its internal economics treat external lasers as a purchased component, so it is structurally incentivized to multi‑source laser supply and drive pricing. For investors seeking pure laser leverage rather than broad CPO exposure, these system and silicon vendors are less direct vehicles.

From an investment standpoint, the highest direct positive leverage to CPO lasers among liquid public names sits with Lumentum, Coherent, Furukawa Electric, and Sivers, with POET and selected Chinese/Japanese module players providing additional, more indirect exposure. Lumentum has the clearest line of sight to large CPO laser revenue and profit, anchored by NVIDIA design‑ins and explicit capex expansion for UHP InP lasers, and already embeds several hundred million dollars of projected CPO laser revenue in FY27–28 forecasts.  Coherent and Furukawa have meaningful CPO laser optionality but with more diversified business models that dampen earnings sensitivity to CPO. Sivers and POET offer more speculative, higher‑beta leverage where modest absolute CPO laser volumes could translate into very large percentage shifts in revenue and valuation, but with commensurate technology, execution, and customer‑adoption risk. For portfolio construction focused specifically on lasers in CPO, a barbell of a core position in Lumentum, supplemented by smaller tactical exposures to Coherent/Furukawa for diversification and Sivers/POET for convex upside, would best align with the underlying industry structure of the CPO laser market.</div>

            <div class="retweeted-text">Ironically, selling off $NVDA on TPU fears reflects the kind of zero-sum/pod-brain thinking that led $GOOG to sell off on OpenAI fears at a fraction of current levels. 

Compute end-demand keeps running ahead of supply and both Google and Anthropic just proved scaling laws aren&#x27;t dead.  Fixating on whether Nvidia -- which still has massive strengths across silicon, systems and software, as well as an unmatched accelerated-computing R&amp;D budget that&#x27;s growing rapidly -- ends up with 85% of the pie or 80% is short-sighted. Especially with the stock likely trading at a mid-to-high teens multiple of its calendar 2027 EPS.</div>

            <p>@david88lee I still think it’s astonishing to overcome last Thursday’s high so easily?
Thursday had the highest trading volume since 04/09, and how come this resistance spx 6770/es 6800 can be so easily taken over by bulls?</p>

            <p>For the two butterfly positions started yesterday:  
Put butterfly booked with 100% gain.  
Call butterfly booked with 800% gain.  
When playing 0DTE in the future, I will only use butterflies instead of single calls/puts, as theta decay is extreme and will clouds my judgment.</p>

            <p>你开个特斯拉，旁边来个人问你这是加91还是93号汽油。你会睬她么？

英伟达这种OpenAI和AMD合作都不发一言，今天破天荒推特发布针对Meta采购Google都TPU，表示祝贺并强调GPU是最牛x的。

因为他真感到威胁了，当然英伟达这么做的本质不是证明自己强 

而是证明他意识到对手开始具备扰动市场叙事能力…

已经开始走下神坛了，绝对的王者，要考虑一个残酷的未来，不是被全面替代，不是没人买了，也不是增长崩了。

而是从75%的毛利“神话定价权”回到“高端工业品”的正常定价。

尽管你可以继续卖最好GPU，享受AI 爆发的红利、你的收入和利润依然能在未来几年继续涨。但客户不再愿意永远给你“垄断溢价”

HBM内存吃一块、台积电代工吃一块，然后现在定制ASIC 比如TPU吃一块，毛利太高就好比诲淫诲盗，人家都盯着

世界变了，从TPU这一刻，“你来我这买,别无选择”的世界不存在了。这就死最大风险。</p>

因为Google的自研芯片取代英伟达的GPU了 

难道这两家都不是都用台积电代工的么？左兜掏右兜啊，而且客户结构更安全，老大老二都找我，溢价能力还高。
